# Clothing Hub

## What Clothing Hub is
Clothing Hub is a Shopping OS for multi-brand fashion. It brings a unified catalog, saved items, cart tools, and stylist-led discovery into one place while purchases happen on retailer sites.

## What problem it solves
Multi-brand shopping creates friction: separate sites, scattered wishlists, and carts that do not talk to each other. Clothing Hub reduces that friction by keeping discovery, saving, and cart prep in one interface.

## How it works
1. Browse a unified catalog across brands.
2. Save items and build a cart in one place.
3. Refine picks with the stylist for fit, budget, or style.
4. Use checkout tools that route you to retailer sites to pay.

## What it is NOT
Clothing Hub is not a retailer and does not process payments. Checkout, shipping, and returns remain with the original stores.
